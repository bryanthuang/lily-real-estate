    content: "<p>I recently had the pleasure of working with Lily as both a first-time buyer and seller. I couldn't be happier with the outcome. She went above and beyond to ensure I found the perfect condo. Her knowledge of the SF market is extensive, and she was able to find a 1 bedroom condo that checked all my boxes. Down the road, she later helped me sell above listing price!</p><p><b>From the moment I met Lily, her exceptional communication skills stood out.</b> She was always prompt in responding to my inquiries and kept me informed every step of the way. Her friendly and approachable demeanor made me feel comfortable discussing my concerns and preferences, and she truly listened to my needs.</p><p>What impressed me the most about Lily was her get-things-done attitude. She was proactive in searching for properties that matched my criteria and wasted no time in scheduling viewings. Her attention to detail was impeccable, and she made sure to guide me through the entire buying process, ensuring I understood each step along the way.</p><p>One aspect that truly set Lily apart was her ability to help me see the selling process from the perspective of the buyer. As a first-time buyer and seller, this was invaluable. She coached me through the entire process, providing insights and advice that helped me make informed decisions. Her expertise and guidance were especially crucial as a single woman with a strict financial budget.</p><p>I recommend Lily highly for anyone looking to buy or sell. <b>Her professionalism, communication skills, friendliness, and get-things-done attitude make her an exceptional realtor.</b> Thank you, Lily, for making my first-time buying and selling experience a positive and successful one!</p>"

    content:"<p>Lily sold my home under the most challenging of circumstances in a market unfavorable towards sellers. She skillfully navigated every obstacle throughout the sale and was able to secure the best price possible for my home at the time. I was tremendously impressed by every offer that she presented to me, as she had already advocated for my interests with each potential buyer before even asking for my consideration. She took the time to understand my preferences and ensured that the result reflected my needs.</p><p><b>Lily is an agent who will go above and beyond for her clients.</b> The objective proof of her talent is reflected in the fact that she was able to sell my home within weeks while there were multiple comparable houses in the same neighborhood that remained on the market for months without any activity. Whether you own a home or are looking to buy one, you absolutely need Lily to represent you in the process. <b>She has the unique ability to turn a stressful situation into the best possible outcome, and I would trust her completely to represent me in future transactions.</b></p>"

    content:"<p>I met Lily in high school and when I started thinking about purchasing a home, I immediately reached out to her. It didn't matter how long it had been since we had seen or spoken to each other, it was as if nothing changed and she was so kind and approachable. I had seen her social media posts of being a real estate agent and knew I could trust her with the process.</p><p>She provided me with a lot of knowledge and support throughout my endeavor and was so on top of everything. I showed and told her what I was looking for, she provided some options and positive/honest feedback, and came with me to look at open houses. When I decided on what I wanted, I felt as though the process did go smoothly - <b>if there were “bumps in the road”, she made sure I knew what was happening and what certain things meant.</b> I appreciate her help and professionalism as a new homeowner, and I highly recommend her services to anyone searching for a home. She's also very knowledgeable of home renovations due to her family's background, which I believe compliments her role as an agent.</p>"

But <b>Lily helped me do just that—achieve what I thought was an impossible pipe dream, all while displaying an incredible amount of patience, empathy, and encouragement along the way.</b> Lily stood by my side as I entertained detours, became my sounding board as I worked through different options, and armed me with all the information I needed to make the right decision.</p><p>I look forward to working with Lily again and would highly recommend her to anyone who is looking to buy or sell their home!</p>"

Lily became a friend, advocate, and advisor as soon as we started working with her. <b>She was the perfect combination of insightful and honest and was always a step ahead of us throughout the entire process.</b> She also made it possible for us to make the search for our home a full family affair (when we started searching I was pregnant with kiddo #3 and it was difficult to tour homes without our 2 big kids too). I know it sounds minor but having her embrace our family as part of the team made a HUGE difference. Our kids still ask about when we will see her again. We feel the same way too ;)</p><p>We are confident we would not have found or successfully landed our home if not for Lily--we are SO grateful for her and plan to recommend her to anyone we know who is on the home hunt.</p>"

    content:"<p>As first-time home buyers, we were lucky to have Lily as our agent.  She took the time to explain the market basics (which for SF is a lot of basics), helped us navigate some unique situations with our best interests in mind, and most importantly provided insights from her experience. Lily was always available to hop on a call or respond via text to questions/concerns/requests. <b>Expertise-wise, I valued her input from both a financial/market perspective as well as from a renovating/design/materials.</b> Lily consistently showed herself as our advocate throughout the home buying process, via communications with sellers, writing terms in the purchase agreement to address our risks and concerns, etc. I never felt like I've asked too many questions, and my advice is to continue to maintain open communication and discuss expectations as agent/client - they are actively listening and will take action with your best interests in mind.</p>"

As first time home-buyers, we had a lot of questions about this stressful process, and she helped us through each and every one of these questions and even encouraged us to consider things that we hadn't thought of yet. <b>She represented our best interests very well by being communicative with our lender, the seller's agent, and of course with us.</b> Next time we are in the market to buy a home, we will be contacting Lily.</p>"
